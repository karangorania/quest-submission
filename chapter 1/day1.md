# Chapter 1

## Day 1

#### 1. Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp

- Blockchain is a decentralized, shared immutable ledger which store the data publicly, and connected to different computers with nodes. It's allowed to stored the digital information & distributed across all nodes.

- Blockchain collects information together in groups known as Blocks.

- No one owns blockchain, it's fully decentralized.

- Bitcoin uses blockchain technology.It exploded after 2009 in various domains like DeFi, NFT, FT etc..

Let's take a example How Bitcoin works :-

- Suppose I want to buy a Mac. I will give my card to the shop owner, ask the bank, it has enough money to buy, then check for records & if yes then it will update in records & say yes to shop owners, it will show movement of money from my account to shop owners. It will take some charges for their third class hard work.

- Now let's remove the bank system from the records. Now I will trust everyone who runs the nodes. It will store on a ledger everywhere in the world with uncountable times. I buy a Mac from the shop for 0.001BTC then it will check everyone's data on the ledger. They will say yes you are good to go & it's also updated on everyone's nodes around the world that he/she spent 0.001BTC. That's how bitcoin works without depending on a third party. If you try to do changes in any block then everyone will know you have done something wrong & you will be caught.

#### 2. Explain what a Smart Contract is. You can read this to help you, but you don't have to: https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts

- Smarts contracts are simple programs which are stored in blockchain when certain conditions are met then it's run. It's similar to agreement between two people without a middleman. You can blindly trust. It can be written in different languages. Most popular is Solidity. It's differ to blockchains.

3. Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.

- Scripts are used to view data on the blockchain. It doesn't charge anything to view data.

- Transactions are used to change the data on blockchain. Suppose I want to send 10 Flow to someone then it will charge a small amount to change on the blockchain. If anything you want to change on blockchain the transaction is used.
