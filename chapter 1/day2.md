# Chapter 1

## Day 2

#### 1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

- Safety & Security
- Clarity
- Approachability
- Developer Experience
- Resource Oriented Programming

#### 2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

These 5 pillars show that how strong these pillars are, they are inter connected. This pillar also solved past language problems & made successful products.

- As a developer there must be `Safety & Security` to use any language.
- It should be user friendly & easy for the ecosystem & give `Clarity` of how everything works.
- Language should have `Developer Experience` too smooth if any error came so developer should know easily by debug & give error with proper reason.
